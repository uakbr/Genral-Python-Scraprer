# Installation Guide

Welcome to the installation guide for our web scraping framework. This document will walk you through the steps required to get the framework up and running on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. If you do not have Git installed, you can download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scraping-framework.git
   cd scraping-framework
   ```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional)**

   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Use the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install all the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install packages like `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `selenium`, and any other dependencies listed in the file.

4. **Install WebDriver**

   If you plan to scrape dynamic content, you will need to install a WebDriver compatible with the browser you intend to use. For example, to install ChromeDriver for Google Chrome:

   - Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver from [chromedriver.chromium.org](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
   - Extract the downloaded file and place it in a known directory.
   - Add the directory containing the ChromeDriver executable to your system's PATH.

5. **Verify Installation**

   To verify that the installation was successful, you can run the example usage script provided in the `/examples` directory:

   ```bash
   python examples/example_usage.py
   ```

   If everything is set up correctly, the script should run without any errors.

## Post-Installation

After installation, you can configure the framework to suit your scraping needs. Refer to the `configuration_guide.md` for detailed instructions on how to configure the framework.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation, please check the following:

- Ensure that all prerequisites are correctly installed.
- Check if the virtual environment is activated before installing dependencies.
- Verify that the WebDriver executable is correctly placed and that its path is added to the system's PATH.

For further assistance, please refer to the `README.md` file or submit an issue on the project's GitHub repository.

Thank you for choosing our web scraping framework. Happy scraping!
