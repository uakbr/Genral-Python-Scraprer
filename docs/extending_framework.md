# Extending the Web Scraping Framework

## Introduction

This document provides guidance on how to extend the web scraping framework to accommodate additional features or to handle specific use cases. The framework is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to create plugins and modules that seamlessly integrate with the core components.

## Creating a Plugin

A plugin is a self-contained module that can be added to the framework to extend its functionality. To create a plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Extension Point**: Determine which part of the framework you want to extend. This could be content extraction, data preprocessing, or dynamic content handling.

2. **Define the Plugin Interface**: Create a Python class that defines the interface for your plugin. This class should inherit from a base class if one is provided for the extension point.

3. **Implement the Plugin**: Write the code for your plugin, implementing the necessary methods defined in the interface.

4. **Register the Plugin**: Add your plugin to the appropriate extension registry within the framework. This will typically involve modifying a configuration file or calling a registration function.

## Example: Content Filter Plugin

To create a content filter plugin, you would:

1. Create a new Python file in the `/extensions/` directory, e.g., `custom_filter.py`.

2. Define a class that inherits from a base content filter class (if available) or adheres to the expected interface.

```python
from extensions.content_filters import BaseContentFilter

class CustomFilter(BaseContentFilter):
    def filter(self, content):
        # Implement your custom filtering logic
        filtered_content = some_filtering_function(content)
        return filtered_content
```

3. Register your new filter in the `content_filters.py` file or through a dedicated plugin manager.

## Modifying Existing Components

If you need to modify an existing component, such as the `HTML Content Parser` or the `Data Preprocessor`, follow these steps:

1. **Subclass the Component**: Create a new class that inherits from the component you wish to extend.

2. **Override Methods**: Override the methods where you want to alter the behavior. Ensure that you call the base class methods using `super()` if you want to retain the original behavior as well.

3. **Update Configuration**: Modify the `config.py` file to use your new subclass instead of the default component.

## Example: Custom HTML Parser

```python
from scraper.html_parser import HTMLParser

class CustomHTMLParser(HTMLParser):
    def parse(self, html_content):
        # Custom parsing logic
        parsed_content = super().parse(html_content)
        # Additional processing
        return parsed_content
```

In `config.py`, update the parser class reference:

```python
from scraper.custom_html_parser import CustomHTMLParser

class CustomConfig(BaseConfig):
    HTML_PARSER_CLASS = CustomHTMLParser
```

## Testing Your Extensions

It is important to thoroughly test any extensions you create. Add unit tests in the `/tests/` directory following the naming convention `test_<your_extension>.py`.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, you can extend the web scraping framework to meet your specific requirements. Always ensure that your extensions are well-documented and tested for maintainability and ease of integration.
