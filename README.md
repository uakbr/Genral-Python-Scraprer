# Web Scraping Framework

Welcome to our Web Scraping Framework, a flexible and extendable tool designed to scrape and extract information from both static and dynamic websites. This framework is particularly tailored for text extraction and is equipped to preprocess data for integration with advanced AI models, such as GPT-4-turbo-preview.

## Features

- HTTP Request Management with robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
- HTML Content Parsing using BeautifulSoup for efficient text extraction.
- Dynamic Content Handling with Selenium WebDriver for interactive web pages.
- Data Preprocessing to clean and format text for AI model consumption.
- Integration with GPT-4-turbo-preview for advanced data analysis.
- Output and Logging to store extracted data and provide detailed process insights.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Web Scraping Framework, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/web-scraping-framework.git
cd web-scraping-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Refer to the `docs/installation.md` for detailed installation instructions.

## Usage

The framework is designed to be simple to use yet highly configurable. You can start a basic scraping task with just a few lines of code:

```python
from scraper.request_manager import RequestManager
from scraper.html_parser import HTMLParser
from scraper.config import BaseConfig

# Initialize the components
request_manager = RequestManager()
html_parser = HTMLParser()

# Fetch and parse a web page
response = request_manager.get('https://example.com')
parsed_content = html_parser.parse(response.text)

# For more examples, refer to the `examples/` directory.
```

For advanced usage and configuration options, please check `docs/usage.md` and `docs/configuration_guide.md`.
